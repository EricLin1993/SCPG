# Non-uniform sampling reconstruction for symmetrical NMR spectroscopy by exploiting inherent symmetry

**The provided code constitutes the experimental component of our work: 'Non-uniform sampling reconstruction for symmetrical NMR spectroscopy by exploiting inherent symmetry'. The code compares the reconstructed spectra obtained under different sampling schedules and using different reconstruction algorithms**



# Instructions

Run the script "test_quinine.m" to reconstruct the experimental data using different algorithms (IST, SCREEN) and different sampling schedules (random, 2D poisson, SCPG).



# Experimental Data

The experimental data is a 1H-1H symmetrical spectra data obtained from the 128 Ã— 128 COSY projection of the homemade 3D TOCSY-COSY spectrum of quinine.
